### Important Tips:
* To bypass certain Anti-Cheats and Proctoring software you must take different approaches, some are extreme and some are simple.
* The Host and VM Machine cannot have the same IPv4 LAN address. That is a clear indicator a VM is being utilized, because network traffic from the same IPv4 LAN Address is being generated from the host.
* Use DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) because it's encrypted. Using a unencrypted DNS means the websites you visit are visible to all, but with DoH the most you can obtain is a external IP address.
* Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to mask all traffic. Remember popular VPNs won't work with some proctoring or Anti-Cheat software, because the VPNs IP ranges might be blacklisted.
